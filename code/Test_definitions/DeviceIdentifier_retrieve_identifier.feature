  Background: Common Device Identifier retrieve identifer setup
    Given the resource "/retrieve-identifier/vwip"  as  base url
    And the header "Content-Type" is set to "application/json"
    And the header "Authorization" is set to a valid access token
    And the header "x-correlator" is set to a UUID value
    And the request body is compliant with the schema Device
    
  @DeviceIdentifier_retrieve_identifier0_phoneNumber_does_not_match_schema
  Scenario Outline: phoneNumber value does not comply with the defined pattern
    Given the request body property "$.phoneNumber" is set to: <phone_number_value>
    When the HTTP "POST" request is sent
    Then the response status code is 400
    And the response property "$.status" is 400
    And the response property "$.code" is "INVALID_ARGUMENT"
    And the response property "$.message" contains a user friendly text

    Examples:
      | phone_number_value |
      | string_value       |
      | 1234567890         |
      | +12334foo22222     |
      | +00012230304913849 |
      | 123                |
      | ++49565456787      |
